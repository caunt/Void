Forwarding passes player information from the proxy to the server, such as the online UUID, name, and IP address.

## None (Offline)
Without any forwarding enabled, the server will use the player's offline UUID and name, and the IP address of the Void proxy.

## Legacy (BungeeCord)
One of the oldest forwarding modes, developed by [SpigotMC](https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord).  
Learn how to configure it in the [**Legacy forwarding**](/docs/forwardings/legacy) page.

## Modern (Velocity)

## Online (Private Key)
