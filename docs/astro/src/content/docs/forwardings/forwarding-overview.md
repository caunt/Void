Forwarding is a feature to pass player's information from proxy to server, such as online UUID, name and IP address.  

## None (Offline)
Without any forwarding enabled, the server will use player's offline UUID, name and IP address of the Void proxy.

## Legacy (BungeeCord)
One of the oldest forwarding modes, developed by [SpigotMC](https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord).  
Learn how to configure it in the [**Legacy forwarding**](../legacy) page.

## Modern (Velocity)
Next generation of forwarding, developed by [PaperMC](https://docs.papermc.io/velocity/player-information-forwarding/).  
Learn how to configure it in the [**Modern forwarding**](../modern) page.

## Online (Private Key)
